# GUNNER
The simple game for project of major Introduction to Information Technology (Using Python and others). 

The game is inspired by the series of passing shooters. The main character will overcome obstacles to reach the final stage. The game uses pixel graphics to create the context and character. This is the first product so there will be many mistakes and fixes in the future.
